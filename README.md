# Mutiple-Regression-Analysis-on-Adult-Mortality-Rate-and-Alcohol-Abstrainers-Alcohol-Consumption
Multiple regression analysis was done with Adult Mortality rate as dependent variable and Alcohol Abstrainers, Alcohol Consumption as independent variables.
Homoscedasticity multiple regression assumption was not met so log of dependent variable was taken. Detailed discussion on regression analysis has been
carried out in the word document.

*Following output was ontained:*

A multiple linear regression was calculated to predict Adult Mortality Rate based on Alcohol Consumption and Alcohol Abstainers. A significant regression equation was found (F(2, 139) = 16.766, p < .000), with an R2 of .194. Log of Adult Mortality Rate is equal to -0.207 + 0.520(AlcoholAbstainers) + 0.015(AlcoholConsumption), where, Alcohol Abstainers is measured in percentage and Alcohol Consumption is measured in litres per capita. Log of Adult Mortality rate increased by 0.520 for every unit increase in Alcohol Abstainers and Log of Adult Mortality rate increased by 0.015 for every unit increase in Alcohol Consumption. Both Alcohol Abstainers and Alcohol Consumption were significant predictors of weight.
